Hotel Web Based Application

Our aims are to build a spontaneous responsive hotel web base application, which could be a way of building our portfolios. 

The first goal is to work on the landing page, to ensure all the navbar buttons are working properly. Achieving this first aim will lead us to go into the second objective which is unknown to me now. 

Yet, at the end of this project, we have to be proud of what we built.

Until thenâ€¦.
